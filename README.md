# 42 Piscine Projects

This repo contains projects I completed during the 42 Piscine â€” an intense, hands-on coding bootcamp focused on learning C programming and low-level programming concepts.

These projects helped me get comfortable with:

- Pointers and memory management  
- Unix commands and shell basics  
- Basic algorithms and problem solving  
- Writing efficient and clean C code  

This foundation prepares me for more advanced programming challenges.
